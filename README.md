# The C Programming Language (K&R C)
## Introduction
__The C Programming Language__, often referred to as the K&R book has been recommended for anyone wanting to learn to program in C, despite the second edition being older than many software developers.  It has aged so well because of it's tutorial format, which has been copied by many authors seeking to teach programming in other languages.
This repository will contain __solutions__ to the __exercises__ presented in each chapter. Surprisingly there have been few changes to the standard since the second edition to the book, and the current standard is C11. So, the solutions and samples from each chapter are updated to the current standard.
