# The C Programming Language (K&R C)
## Introduction
__The C Programming Language__, or "the K&R book" has been recommended for anyone wanting to learn to program in C, since it was first published. It has aged so well because of it's tutorial format, which has been copied by many authors seeking to teach programming in other languages.
This repository will contain __solutions__ to the __exercises__ presented in each chapter of the second edition. Surprisingly there have been few changes to the standard since the second edition to the book, and the current standard is __C17__ also known as "ISO/IEC 9899:2018". So, the solutions and samples from each chapter are updated to the current standard.
